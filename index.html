            <p><b>Ritchie</b> is best known as the creator of the <b>C programming language</b> and key developer of the
                <b>Unix operating system</b>, he worked together with <b>Ken Thompson</b>, who is credited with writing
                the original version of <b>Unix</b>. One of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its
                porting to different machines and platforms.</p>
            <p>During the <b>1960s</b>, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at <b>Bell
                    Labs</b>. However, Bell Labs pulled out of the project in 1969. Thompson then found an old
                <b>PDP-7</b> machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided
                by Ritchie and others. In 1970, <b>Brian Kernighan</b> suggested the name "<b>Unix</b>", a pun on the
                name "Multics". To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson
                created B. Later, B was replaced by <b>C</b>, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the
                development of Unix and C for many years.</p>
            <p><b>Ritchie</b> liked to emphasize that he was just one member of a group. He suggested that many of the
                <b>improvements</b> he introduced simply</p>
            <p class="text-center"><em>"looked like a <b>good thing</b> to do,"</em></p>
            <p>and that anyone else in the same place at the same time might have done the same thing. But <b>Bjarne
                    Stroustrup</b> who designed <b>C++</b> said<p class="text-center"><em>"If <b>Dennis</b> had
                        decided to spend that decade on esoteric math, <b>Unix</b> would have been stillborn."</em></p>
            </p>
            <p>Nowadays, the <b>C</b> language is widely used today in application, <b>operating system</b>, and
                embedded system development, and its influence is seen in most modern <b>programming languages</b>. Unix
                has also been influential, establishing <b>computing</b> concepts and principles that have been widely
                adopted.</p>
